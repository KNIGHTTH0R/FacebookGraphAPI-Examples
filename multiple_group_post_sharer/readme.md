- You will have to clone the complete repo to use this program.
- A 'collection' is a collection of groups.
- You can share same post to one collection with same message in a single click!
- Collections are stored as .txt files so you can create different collections for different purposes and once made...use them anytime!
- Facebook Graph API does not allow to access the details of the groups of which the user is a 'member' except the groups he/she is an 'admin' of.
  So to create a collection, I have added a function to search for groups. The search result is obtained in a pretty checkbox list(made using Tkinter GUI).
  The selected groups are added to the collection. The collections could be updated as well!
- To share your post...all you need is a [User Access Token](https://github.com/nikhilkumarsingh/FacebookGraphAPI-Examples/blob/master/README.md)
  and the link to the post you want to share to the collection!
  You can also add some additional message to the shared post!
